### Issues

Issues are very valuable to this project.

Thank you for creating them.

### Pull Requests

Pull requests are, a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

When deciding to merge in a pull request, look at the following things:

#### Does it state intent

Be clear which problem is trying to be solved with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells the problem found, and the pull request shows the action taken to solve it.
