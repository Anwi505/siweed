WaveMaker controls text:
With these controls you can adjust the wavemaker to create larger, smaller, faster, or slower waves. The "Sea State" mode will allow you to adjust the parameters of a more natural wave sequence, whereas "Function Mode" gives you control of a standard sine wave. See how adjusting wave parameters affects how much power can be harvested from the waves.
WEC controls text:
These controls adjust the wave energy converter. "Torque" mode will apply a constant force up or down, regardless of what the wave looks like. "Feedback" mode will act like car's suspension. The P gain will determine how much the WEC reacts to a change in positoin, much like a spring. The D gain will change how much the WEC resists change, like a damper. With a high D gain, and no P gain, the WEC won't care where it is, but will always resist movement. With high P gain and no D gain, the WEC will only try to push towards or away from its original position. Try to balance these to maximize power output.

FFT text:
This is a frequency analysis of the wave. Any wave can be imagined as a combination of waves with a single frequency. This chart shows how strong each of those component waves. The x-axis is the frequency of that wave component, and the y-axis is the intesity of that wave component.
Power meter text:
This shows how much power the WEC is producing. If it's positive, it's producing power. If it's negative, it's using power. Try to produce enough power to light up all four of the lights.
